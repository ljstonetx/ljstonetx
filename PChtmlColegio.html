By fostering the development of Hispanic leaders and encouraging them to challenge the political system the college generated both controversy and transformation. The local newspaper chronicled events related to Colegio from 1970 to 1973 providing a timeline that highlights the contentious dynamics between the college supporters and detractors including the local Baptist preacher. The historic building which housed the college burned down in 1977 and the structure was demolished shortly thereafter.

As a conservative Republican I was anathema to the ultra-liberal ideologues of the college. The speaking engagement would be confrontational. Like Daniel I was walking into the lions den.

They would not attack the incumbent Texas State Senator Jim Bates a Democrat. He was too glib in both languages. State Representative Raul Longoria also a democrat hardly ever showed his face during the campaign. He was using the phantom strategy - You cannot attack what you dont see. Ricardo Molina the third party candidate was running on the Raza Unida ticket. He was one of them.  So I was it. I took them on one against many.
