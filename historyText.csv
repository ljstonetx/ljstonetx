"No Man's Land","Rio Rico"," The community known as Rio Rico was originally north of the Rio Grande River on land surrounded by a bend in the river. In July 1906 the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built a cutoff to direct the river into a more direct course. As a result Río Rico came to be located south of the border in Mexico.

The saloons and gambling are long gone but the small community of Rio Rico remains across the border 7 miles south of Mercedes.","B001",30
