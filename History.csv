Sumerlin daily excoriated Colegio for being a hotbed for Chicano activists.  -- Communists - was the term he used to describe them.  As a conservative Republican I was anathema to the ultra-liberal ideologues of the college. The speaking engagement would be confrontational. Like Daniel I was walking into the lions den.

They would not attack the incumbent Texas State Senator Jim Bates a Democrat. He was too glib in both languages. State Representative Raul Longoria also a democrat hardly ever showed his face during the campaign. He was using the phantom strategy - You cannot attack what you dont see. Ricardo Molina the third party candidate was running on the Raza Unida ticket. He was one of them.  So I was it. I took them on one against many. I walked out feeling I had earned their respect.",https://books.google.com/books/about/Mercedes.html?id=54-6PgAACAAJ
