Brickmakers were skilled craftsmen who understood selection and harvesting of  clay, building molds, pouring clay, as well building wood fired kilns and firing bricks.  

Brickmaking skills were passed generationally through families. One family member described their skills: 'They all knew how to mold [haver hechura]. They knew clay, which clay to use for brick. They knew how to fire [quemar]. They knew how to set [asentrar] bricks in the kiln. They learned all that from their father'.

Brickyards like this one were located south of Mercedes, close to the Rio Grande River, where deposits of alluvial clays provided the raw material needed for brick manufacturing. [9] Typically, buildings using this type of brick were covered with stucco. Some of the early buildings standing today are probably constructed using this locally produced brick. These include the Graham School at 203 W 10th Street and the building at 246 S Texas Street, which was the original Hidalgo Bank.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/B002.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5158/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/A001.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> A001</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Original Hidalgo County Bank Building on Northeast Corner of Texas and 3rd </strong></font><font color="grey">1913 </font><br><br><font size="2.5em">The Hidalgo County Bank building, which is pictured here was founded in 1907 by J.M. Johnson, William M. Price, S.P. Silver, and John Closner. It was the first bank in Mercedes. Several of the founders were also investors in the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company. Other early banks in Mercedes included Planters Bank and First National Bank. In 1928, Hidalgo County Bank moved to a new building that was constructed diagonally across the street in the empty lot seen here. The bank survived the Great Depression of the 1930s and thrived until it collapsed during the banking crisis in 1989.  The original building still stands today and has been occupied by many businesses over the years.

Today the building houses a restaurant. The building and those to its right still retain many of their original Spanish Colonial architectural features.

Steam heat is provided for every office...The interior of banking rooms present a most unusual effect with walnut fixtures throughout, and a tile floor of rich mosaic colorings. Windows for ten tellers are provided, with separate offices for bank officials. ' The building was one of several in Mercedes designed by R. Newell Waters. [69]

Hidalgo County Bank and Trust was 82 years, 26 days old when it was closed  on July 26, 1989 by the Texas State Banking Commission after being declared insolvent.  [93] The building remains standing today in 2023, but the fine exterior was covered over during a renovation project in the 1990s.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/L015.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5321/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/I003.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> I003</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Mercedes Elks Club with Elegant Ballroom Was A Popular Venue </strong></font><font color="grey">1928 </font><br><br><font size="2.5em">The Elks Club built this Mediterranean-style building with a red tile roof, stucco exterior, and arched windows at Missouri Avenue and 2nd Street in Mercedes in 1928. It stands today but is now boarded up and abandoned. During the Great Depression, the Elks Lodge's revenues declined, and businesses began to rent office space in the building. It became the Chamber of Commerce Building in the 1940s. [64][65] When  the older Mercedes Hotel that stood at the corner of Texas and Second Street was demolished in the 1950s, this building became a hotel, and was renamed the Mercedes Hotel.  So, it often confused with the older Mercedes Hotel.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/I003.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5318/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/L013.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> L013</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Mercedes Chamber of Commerce and Part of Business District </strong></font><font color="grey">1940 </font><br><br><font size="2.5em">Looking East from Missouri Avenue and 3rd Street, this postcard features the Chamber of Commerce building that was originally built as the Elk's Lodge.

Upon completion of the building in 1928, the newspaper reported  'The building with its spacious corner lot represents a total investment of 65,000 dollars and is one of the most handsome fraternal lodge homes south of San Antonio. It is of beautiful architectural design and modern in all of its appointments. The interior has been neatly and artistically decorated and it now awaits furnishing.'

Valley Industries, located between Mercedes and Weslaco, produced beverages such as Delaware Punch.

Even industrial buildings included Mission Revival architecture features such as the parapets which crown the exterior walls of the Valley Industry buildings seen in this postcard.

The advertisement on the back of this card says: The Valley Home of Delaware Punch. The largest Beverage plant in South Texas where only pure food beverages are manufactured.

According to the historic marker at the former site:  The citrus industry was an integral part of the Rio Grande Valley economy in the 20th century.  In 1932, valley citrus producers formed the Rio Grande Valley Citrus Exchange. The exchange began production under the labels of TexSun and TexMaid, and later had a box company, juicing and canning facilities, and a dehydration plant for citrus pulp-based cattle feed.  Texsun became a public corporation in 1956. The plant ceased operations in 1991. [92] Today, the Citrus World Corporation produces juice with the TexSun name today from citrus grown in Florida and Mexico.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/F007.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5347/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/Q002.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> Q002</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Many Mercedes Residents Worked For Texsun Juice Plant </strong></font><font color="grey">1949 </font><br><br><font size="2.5em">This is an advertisement postcard for the Texsun Juice Company. The company produced juice from Valley citrus oranges and grapefruits from the 1930s until 1991. The citrus processing plant was located between Mercedes and Weslaco at one time.  Families living near the plant recall the ever-present scent of oranges and grapefruits being processed and the sound of boilers running 24 hours a day.

Texsun Juice Company was a major employer in the area until the late 1980s. In order to save money and increase profits, farmers began to grow less labor-intensive crops such as grain, cotton, and sugarcane instead of citrus. As a result of reduced citrus production, the company eventually closed.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/Q002.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5337/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/A111.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> A111</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>The First American Rio Grande Land & Irrigation Building </strong></font><font color="grey">1907 </font><br><br><font size="2.5em">Very early postcard picture of the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company offices, one of the first buildings in Mercedes.
